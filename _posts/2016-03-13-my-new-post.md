He traveled over 350 miles to cut the beech trees for the glass works in Rosteig. Why? We are not sure. Perhaps a glass worker there knew of him and knew he could cut the trees so they burned evenly which was an issue. One can only guess it was due to his craftsmanship.


Notes for Christian Faisthauer Feisthauer:

This is the Letter Edouard send me which got the ballrolling, causing the chain reaction which now links my family tree to Franceand many relatives I have yet to meet. Thank You Lord for All Your Blessings.

Margaret Ann,
My name is Edouard FESTOR. I am French, living in Germany,near Munich. I found your Emails in the WEB and saw that you have somelink(s) to the FESTOR family. Since I am also interested in genealogicalresearch, I would be very happy if you sent to me any information about theFESTORs you have and perhaps we can find a link between us. The oldest FESTOR(my ancestor) I found was born in France, Alsace, in a little village called Rosteig, the 3rd of June 1661. His name was Hans Jakob FAISTAUER. He married ROSENBERGER Margaret (about 1684)and was a Glassmaker master, in Lauterbach (Sarre, Germany, near the frenchfrontier). He spoke
German and was not able to read or to write, so that his name has been changed byFrench speaking priests into FESTOR about 1700.
His father was FAISTAUER Christian and his mother NN... Suzanne. They came from thehamlet of Faistau, 2km from Lofer,near Salzburg (Austria). This FAISTAUER family can be followed up until about1450. They were farmers in Faistau (Austria).
If you are interested by more information, please feel free to Email. 
avec toutes mes amitiés

A environ 2km au Nord Ouest de Lofer, une commune autrichienne du pays de Salzburg, existe le Hameau de Faistau dont les habitants sont appelés "Faistauer" d'ou lenom de famille "Faistauer". Vers 1650, avec d'autres Autrichiens( Pagetsch, Neudecker) Faistauer Christian et son frère Georges s'établssent dans la région de South en Alsace Bossue où ils travaillent comme bucherons à la verrerie de Rosteig-Kalenberg.Le couple Faistauer Jean Jacob et Rosenberger Marguerite s'établit en Sarre, où il fonde avec son fils Jean Adam et avec d'autres verriers, la verrerie de Lauterbach; c'est à cette époque, à Creutzwald (Moselle) la paroisse dont dépendait Lauterbach, que le nom de Feistauer ou Faistauer se transforma progressivement en "Festo"; Jean Jacob Faistauer allias Festor, est par concéquent et selon toute vraisemblance,l'ancêtre commun à tous les "Festor"
